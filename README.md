# LinkedOut

> *Effortlessly remove LinkedIn connections.*

This extension creates a remove button that appears bellow your connections in [LinkedIn's connection page](https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/invite-connect/connections/). This way, you only have to click once to remove a connection.

## Why
When I first started using LinkedIn, I thought that the more connections I had, the better. Then I ended up with a bunch of meaningless connections: people that I don't know; people that aren't in my field of interests and people that I will never talk to. So I decided to remove most of them and only connect with people that I know or that I think that can bring value to my life and career.

Furthermore, LinkedIns algorithm works in this way: 

- First, they recommend your post to a small group of people
- Then, based on their reaction/interaction, they will decide if your post should be recommended to more people
- People that know you are more likely to interact with your posts -> keep the circle small and the real ones close

Curiously, after I removed more than 500 connections, I started receiving much more invitations.
